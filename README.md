# Methods
A selection of the analytical processes and tools we use to provide rigorous and actionable results to our clients. If you are interested in a project with EICC please contact us via email at eicc@emory.edu or call us at (404) 778-5123

# Power & Sample Size Assesment with PROPER
A demonstration of the R/Bioconductor package PROPER which uses simulation of experimental design constraints to provide guidance on how many people each comparison group needs for sufficient statistical power.

# RNA-Seq Analysis with baySeq
A demonstraton of the R/Bioconductor package baySeq to perform differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq count data. baySeq uses empirical Bayes methodology to estimate prior and posterior likelihoods of differential expression between comparison groups.

# False Discovery Rate Estimation with qvalue
A demonstraton of the R/Bioconductor package qvalue to estimate global and local false discovery rates from p-values and test statistics calculated from  differential expression analysis.
