# Power & Sample Size Assesment for RNA-Seq Differential Expression Analysis Using PROPER
A demonstration of the R/Bioconductor package PROPER which uses simulation of experimental design constraints to provide guidance on how many people each comparison group needs for sufficient statistical power.

# RNA-Seq Differential Expression Analysis Using baySeq
A demonstraton of the R/Bioconductor package baySeq to perform differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq count data. baySeq uses empirical Bayes methodology to estimate prior and posterior likelihoods of differential expression between comparison groups. 

# False Discovery Rate Estimation Using qvalue
A demonstraton of the R/Bioconductor package qvalue to estimate global and local false discovery rates from p-values and test statistics calculated from  differential expression analysis.
